  <div style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.0rem; color: #243033;">Can we build it?</div>

  <div style="font-size: 0.875rem;">
    <div style="font-weight: 700; color: #174b84;">Low Risk | 0, 10</div>
    <div style="color: #243033;">Our current <span style="font-weight: 700;">Architecture requires minor enhancement</span> to support the technology and we have the skills to do the work.</div>

    <div style="font-weight: 700; color: #174b84;">Medium Risk | 30</div>
    <div style="color: #243033;">The current <span style="font-weight: 700;">Architecture will need major modification</span> to support this technology but need to verify that this in fact the case.</div>

    <div style="font-weight: 700; color: #174b84;">High Risk | 70, 100</div>
    <div style="color: #243033;">This is an <span style="font-weight: 700;">entirely new technology that our current architecture does not support</span> and we will need to train someone on how to use it.</div>
